# Day 5: Connecting MERN Components

## Overview
Welcome to **Day 5** of our MERN stack development journey! In this session, we'll focus on integrating **MongoDB**, **Express**, and **Node.js** to build a robust **RESTful API**. This integration is crucial for enabling your frontend application to communicate with a backend server, allowing for dynamic data interactions.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Understand the MERN architecture and its components.
- Set up MongoDB to store and retrieve data.
- Create a Node.js server using Express framework.
- Build a RESTful API that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Topics Covered
- **Integrating MongoDB, Express, and Node.js**
  - Overview of MERN stack.
  - Configuring MongoDB and Express.
  - Setting up server routes.
  - Handling HTTP requests and responses.

## Project Details
### MERN API Repo
This repository contains the API code that connects to MongoDB. The project demonstrates how to implement a RESTful API using the MERN stack.

### Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.
- **RESTful Architecture**: Clear and structured API endpoints for easy consumption.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for improved user experience.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity using Mongoose.

## Getting Started
To get your API up and running, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **MongoDB** (installed locally or via [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### API Endpoints
Below is a list of available API endpoints along with their functionalities:

- **GET** `/api/items`
  - Retrieve all items from the database.
  - **Response**: JSON array of items.

- **POST** `/api/items`
  - Create a new item in the database.
  - **Request Body**: 
    ```json
    {
        "name": "Item Name",
        "description": "Item Description"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: JSON object of the created item.

- **GET** `/api/items/:id`
  - Retrieve a specific item by its ID.
  - **Response**: JSON object of the requested item.

- **PUT** `/api/items/:id`
  - Update an existing item by its ID.
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
        "name": "Updated Item Name",
        "description": "Updated Item Description"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: JSON object of the updated item.

- **DELETE** `/api/items/:id`
  - Delete an item from the database by its ID.
  - **Response**: JSON object confirming deletion.

### Example Requests
#### Create a New Item
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/items -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Sample Item", "description": "This is a sample item."}'
```

#### Get All Items
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/items
```

### Error Handling
The API includes robust error handling to ensure that users receive informative responses. Common errors include:
- **400 Bad Request**: Returned when the request is invalid.
- **404 Not Found**: Returned when a requested resource is not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Returned when there is a server error.

### Data Validation
Using **Mongoose**, the API ensures that all data meets specified criteria before being saved to the database. This helps prevent incorrect data entries.

### Testing the API
You can test the API endpoints using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [cURL](https://curl.se/). These tools allow you to make HTTP requests and inspect the responses.

### Example Response
When retrieving all items, the response might look like this:
```json
[
    {
        "_id": "60d0fe4f5311236168a109ca",
        "name": "Sample Item",
        "description": "This is a sample item.",
        "__v": 0
    }
]
```
