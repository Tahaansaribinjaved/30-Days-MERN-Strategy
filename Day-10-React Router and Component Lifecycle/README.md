# Day 10: React Router and Component Lifecycle

## 🚀 **Overview**
Welcome to **Day 10** of your React journey! Today, you'll explore the power of **React Router** to create dynamic multi-page applications and dive deep into the **component lifecycle** to understand how React components behave over time.

---

## 📝 **Topics Covered**
- **React Router**: Implement routing to switch between multiple pages.
- **Component Lifecycle**: Learn how React components are created, updated, and destroyed.

---

## 🔧 **Tasks**
1. **Add Routing to Your App**:
   - Create and configure routes for multiple pages:
     - **Home**: A welcome page with a brief intro.
     - **About**: Share details about your blog or project.
     - **Blog**: List your blog posts or relevant content.

2. **Component Lifecycle**:
   - Utilize **React lifecycle methods** such as:
     - `componentDidMount()`
     - `componentDidUpdate()`
     - `componentWillUnmount()`
   - Use these methods within your components to manage state and side effects.

## 💻 **Project Update**
For this day, you will be working on the **Simple-Blog-App** repository.

- **Repository Name**: `Simple-Blog-App`
- **Goal**: Implement multi-page functionality using React Router and improve the component lifecycle handling.

### **Key Features to Implement**:
- **Navigation Bar**: Allow users to navigate between Home, About, and Blog pages.
- **Page Content**: Create dynamic and engaging content for each page.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Log lifecycle events in the console to understand the flow of your components.
