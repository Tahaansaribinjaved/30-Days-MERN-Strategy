# 🌟 Day 11: Context API and State Management

## 📚 Overview

Welcome to Day 11 of our React journey! Today, we're diving into **Context API** for managing global state within our application. This project focuses on implementing user authentication state management using Context API, making our app cleaner and more efficient.

---

## 🔑 Topics Covered

- **Understanding the Context API**
- **Managing Global State**
- **User Authentication State Management**

---

## ✅ Tasks

1. **Implement Context API:**
   - Set up a context to manage user authentication state.
   - Create a provider component to wrap the application and share authentication data.
   - Utilize the `useContext` hook to access authentication data across components.

2. **Push Code Updates:**
   - Showcase the Context API implementation by pushing code updates to the repository.
   - Ensure all components that require authentication state are wrapped with the context provider.
