# Day 4: React.js Basics

## Overview

Welcome to **Day 4** of your React.js journey! Today, we'll be focusing on setting up a React application, understanding the fundamentals of components, JSX, and props, and applying that knowledge by building a simple React app with functional components.

By the end of this session, you'll have a working React application, and you'll be familiar with the essential building blocks of React that are crucial for building dynamic and modular user interfaces.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Setting Up a React Application**
   - Learn how to create a React app using **Create React App (CRA)**.
   - Understand the basic folder structure of a React project.

### 2. **Components in React**
   - Learn the concept of **components** and how they help in dividing the UI into reusable parts.
   - Understand **functional components**, and how they differ from class-based components.

### 3. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**
   - Explore **JSX**, the syntax extension of JavaScript that allows you to write HTML within JavaScript code.
   - Learn how to use JSX effectively within React components.

### 4. **Props**
   - Understand the concept of **props** (short for properties) in React.
   - Learn how to pass data from one component to another using props.

## Project: Building a Simple React App

### Goal:
Build a simple React app to solidify your understanding of functional components, JSX, and props.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize the Project**
   - Create a new React app using the following command:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app react-basics
     ```
   - Navigate into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd react-basics
     ```

2. **Create Functional Components**
   - Create a component `App.js` as the main component.
   - Add a `Header` component that displays the title of your app.
   - Add a `UserInfo` component that takes **props** (like name and age) and displays user information dynamically.

3. **Utilize JSX**
   - Use JSX syntax to render HTML elements and embed JavaScript expressions within your components.
   - Example: 
     ```jsx
     <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>
     ```

4. **Pass Props**
   - Pass props from the `App` component to the `UserInfo` component and display dynamic user data.

5. **Styling the App**
   - Optionally, add some basic styles using CSS or inline styles for a more polished look.

## Folder Structure

Hereâ€™s an overview of the key files in your React app:

```plaintext
react-basics/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # The main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js          # Main component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js        # Entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header.js   # Header component
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ UserInfo.js # Component to display user information
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # Project configuration
```

---

## How to Run the App

To get the app up and running locally:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd react-basics
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Sample Code

Hereâ€™s a brief example of how the components might look:

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import Header from './components/Header';
import UserInfo from './components/UserInfo';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Header title="React Basics" />
      <UserInfo name="John Doe" age={28} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```jsx
// Header.js
import React from 'react';

function Header(props) {
  return <h1>{props.title}</h1>;
}

export default Header;
```

```jsx
// UserInfo.js
import React from 'react';

function UserInfo(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserInfo;
```

## Deployment

Once you're satisfied with your app, you can push your code to your repository on GitHub:

1. Add your changes to git:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit - React Basics"
   ```

3. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
